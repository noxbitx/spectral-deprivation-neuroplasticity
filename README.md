# Spectral-Deprivation-Neuroplasticity


## Long-Term Color Vision Rewiring via Optical Filtering

Author: Noxbit
Start Date: June 2025
Target Duration: 12 months
Target Outcome: Permanent cortical suppression of S- and M-cone input


---

## Objective

Train the brain to ignore green and blue light stimuli through prolonged exposure to red longpass filters, simulating advanced Deuteranopia and Tritanopia, achieving a unique, stable state of functional colorblindness that is self-induced and neurologically adapted.


## Method

Full-time wear of custom longpass red filters that block all wavelengths below ~610nm, ensuring maximal suppression of green and blue input

Secondary layer using yellow lenses as base frame, with red filters stacked on top, for modularity and social acceptability

Red-light-friendly environments created for nighttime adaptation, including amber bulbs and warm LEDs

Weekly breaks for personal reasons for 20–30 minutes of brief exposure to full-spectrum light, carefully monitored and limited

# ⚠️ Important Disclaimer ⚠️

> This repository documents a personal scientific self-experiment involving prolonged spectral deprivation and neural adaptation. The methods described are not intended for replication by the general public and carry potential risks to ocular and neurological health.

I am not a medical professional, and this experiment is conducted for informational and exploratory purposes only. The suppression of visual cone input, particularly through artificial filtering or UV exposure, can lead to permanent vision alteration and unforeseen neurological consequences.

DO NOT attempt to replicate this experiment without medical oversight, professional supervision, and a full understanding of the risks involved. This project is shared for documentation, theoretical discussion, and scientific curiosity only.


## Hypothesis

By starving the brain of S- and M-cone stimuli over a long period, the cortical regions that process those signals will either die, become inactive or be reassigned, leading to a perceptual state identical to Deuteranopia + Tritanopia, without requiring photoreceptor damage

## Daily Routine Overview

Red filters worn at all times, except during controlled exceptions like IPL Most indoor and outdoor activity filtered Lighting modified when needed to maintain perceptual consistency


---

## Tracking

Weekly perception checks using Ishihara tests under low light

Environmental adaptation notes recorded bi-weekly

Mood, energy, and perception logs stored privately

## ⚠️Risks

Potential S-cone and M-cone physical degradation if combined with UV exposure Social and medical misinterpretation of long-term filter use Psychological side effects from altered world perception (color fatigue, dissociation)


---

### Phase 1

Comfort Training Duration: 2–3 days
Objective: Acclimate to permanent eyewear habit using yellow base lenses

### Phase 2

Red Rewiring Begins Duration: 6–12 months
Objective: Initiate neural rewiring and perceptual reassignment by blocking S and M wavelengths completely

### Phase 3

Post-Rewire Perception Drift Duration: Ongoing
Objective: Study how the brain maintains suppressed perception after filter removal, assess permanence and resistance to regression

## Memetic Legacy (for fun but also science)

"Imagine not being colorblind in 2025"

"3 cones? Couldn’t be me"

"Red is the new RGB"

## Final Goal

To become the first documented case of self-induced non-genetic dual-cone suppression via optical means, contributing to cognitive neuroscience, visual plasticity research and the understanding of brain–perception rewiring in adult humans
